# ADR 0007: Use of API Gateway

## Status
- **Approved**

## Context
Our service-oriented architecture (SOA) comprises multiple backend services like user management, inventory management, and payment processing. Managing these services efficiently is critical for ensuring seamless communication, security, and scalability. Without a centralized mechanism, direct communication between client applications and backend services can lead to several challenges:

- **Increased Complexity**: Clients need to handle routing and communication with multiple backend services, making the architecture harder to manage and prone to errors.
- **Security Risks**: Exposing backend services directly to the clients increases the risk of unauthorized access and security breaches.
- **Scalability Issues**: Without centralized routing and load balancing, scaling individual services becomes inefficient and inconsistent.

The approval of the API Gateway as a single entry point addresses these challenges by centralizing the management of cross-cutting concerns like authentication, SSL termination, request logging, and response composition. This decision ensures a secure, maintainable, and scalable architecture, aligning with the systemâ€™s current and future requirements.

## Decision
The project will implement an API Gateway to act as the centralized access point for all client requests. Specifically:
1. **Authentication and Security**: The API Gateway will manage authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and SSL termination to secure communications.
2. **Routing and Protocol Translation**: It will route incoming client requests to the appropriate backend services, translating protocols if required (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket).
3. **Response Composition**: For scenarios involving multiple services, the gateway will aggregate data and deliver unified responses to the clients.
4. **Load Balancing**: To ensure system performance and reliability, the gateway will distribute incoming requests evenly across backend instances.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: It will collect logs and metrics, providing centralized monitoring and simplifying debugging and analysis.

The API Gateway will be configured using tools that support scalability, security, and integration with our chosen technology stack, ensuring compatibility with Angular and MySQL.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Simplifies client-side communication by abstracting the backend service architecture.
  - Enhances system security by consolidating access control and reducing exposure of internal services.
  - Improves scalability and reliability with centralized load balancing and caching mechanisms.
  - Streamlines monitoring and maintenance by centralizing logging and metrics collection.

- **Negative**:
  - Introduces a single point of failure, necessitating high availability configurations and monitoring.
  - Adds an additional layer to the architecture, which increases setup and maintenance complexity.
  - Can become a performance bottleneck if not properly scaled to handle traffic.
