# ADR 0005: Implementation of JWT for Authentication

## Status
- Approved

## Context
In developing the Advanced Media Library System, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication across various services in our service-oriented architecture is critical. The system needs a robust method to authenticate and authorize users that can also support stateless operations given the distributed nature of our services. Based on the current implementation of the login workflow in our codebase, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have been selected as the authentication mechanism.

## Decision
The system will implement JWT-based authentication with the following features:

1. **Token Issuance**:
   - Upon successful login, the server will generate a JWT containing user-specific claims, such as user ID and role, which will be signed using a secure algorithm (e.g., HMAC with SHA-256).
   - The token will include an expiration time (`exp`) to enhance security.

2. **Token Transmission and Storage**:
   - JWTs will be transmitted to the client through a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS) and stored in a secure manner (e.g., HTTP-only cookies) to minimize the risk of XSS attacks.

3. **Token Validation**:
   - Protected endpoints will validate incoming JWTs by verifying the signature and expiration time to ensure authenticity and validity.

4. **Role-Based Authorization**:
   - The JWT payload will include claims indicating the user's role (e.g., ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, MEMBER). Based on this information, the system will enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive resources.

5. **Stateless Authentication**:
   - No session state will be stored on the server; the JWT itself will contain all the information required to validate the user, aligning with the distributed nature of the system.

## Consequences

- **Positive**
   - **Stateless Operation**: JWT supports stateless authentication, reducing dependency on server-side session storage and improving scalability in a service-oriented architecture.
   - **Scalability**: Facilitates horizontal scaling since tokens are self-contained and do not require centralized session management.
   - **Security and Flexibility**: Tokens are signed and can include expiration times. They can also be easily transmitted over secure networks, enabling cross-domain authentication.

- **Negative**
   - **Security Risks**: 
     - If tokens are intercepted (e.g., over an insecure channel), they could be misused. Mitigation measures include enforcing HTTPS, secure storage, and short expiration times.
     - Improper management of sensitive claims in the payload could expose data.
   - **Complexity in Token Management**:
     - Handling token expiration, renewal, and revocation (e.g., after logout) requires clear strategies and robust implementation.
