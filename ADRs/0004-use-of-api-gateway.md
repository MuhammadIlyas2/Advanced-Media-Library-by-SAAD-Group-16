# ADR 0004: Use of API Gateway

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
Our service-oriented architecture (SOA) involves multiple backend services such as user management, inventory control, and payment processing. Managing communication between these services and the client applications introduces complexities such as ensuring security, load balancing, and providing a uniform interface to consumers. An API Gateway can simplify these challenges by acting as a single entry point for all client requests, facilitating the management of cross-cutting concerns.

## Decision
We propose to implement an API Gateway to manage and route requests between the client applications and backend services. The API Gateway will:
- Serve as the single entry point for all client-side requests.
- Handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, SSL termination, and request logging.
- Provide request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
- Enhance security by shielding individual services from direct external access.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Simplifies client-side architecture by centralizing common functionalities at a single point, reducing the complexity of interacting with distributed microservices.
  - Enhances security by abstracting the internal structure of the application and providing a layer that can handle security policies uniformly.
  - Improves scalability and manageability by allowing for efficient load balancing and maintenance without direct client involvement.
  
- **Negative**:
  - Introduces a single point of failure, which could lead to system-wide outages if the API Gateway becomes unavailable.
  - Potentially creates a performance bottleneck if not properly scaled, as all traffic must pass through this gateway.
  - Increases the complexity of the system architecture, requiring careful management and monitoring.
