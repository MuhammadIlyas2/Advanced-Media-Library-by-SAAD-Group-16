# ADR 0006: Implement Error Handling Mechanisms in Login Workflow

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
In the Advanced Media Library System, robust error handling mechanisms are essential for maintaining system reliability and supporting seamless authentication processes. Without structured error handling, users may encounter unexpected issues, and diagnosing problems can become challenging. Establishing comprehensive error-handling practices will ensure a more reliable and maintainable login workflow.

## Decision
The system will implement error-handling mechanisms in the login workflow with the following features:

1. **Validation of User Inputs**:
   - Ensure that users provide both email and password before attempting to log in.

2. **Error Handling for API Responses**:
   - Display server-provided error messages for failed authentication attempts.
   - Provide fallback messages (e.g., "Login failed. Please try again.") for cases where server feedback is unavailable.

3. **Loading State Management**:
   - Display a loading indicator during asynchronous login operations to prevent multiple submissions and inform users of ongoing processes.

4. **Role-Based Navigation**:
   - Redirect users to appropriate pages based on their roles (e.g., Admin users to `/admin_homepage`).

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
   - **Improved System Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling minimizes disruptions caused by unexpected issues.
   - **Role-Specific Navigation**: Users are redirected appropriately based on their roles, ensuring access to relevant features.

- **Negative**:
   - **Development Overhead**: Requires additional effort to implement input validation, error handling, and role-based navigation.
   - **Scalability Concerns**: The logic for role-based redirection and error handling may grow complex with additional user roles and scenarios.
