# ADR 0009: Integration of Third-Party Payment Services

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
The Advanced Media Library System requires a reliable and secure method to handle transactions for services such as membership fees, fines, and other payments. Integrating a third-party payment service will streamline payment processes and ensure security compliance, which is critical for handling financial transactions.

## Decision
We propose to integrate third-party payment services like Stripe, PayPal, or Square to manage all payment transactions within the system. These services offer robust security measures, compliance with financial regulations, and extensive support for various payment methods, which can enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - **Security and Compliance**: By using established third-party services, the system leverages their expertise in security and compliance with financial regulations like PCI DSS.
  - **User Experience**: Supports a wide range of payment methods, improving accessibility and convenience for users.
  - **Reliability**: These services are known for their reliability and efficient handling of high transaction volumes.
  
- **Negative**:
  - **Dependency**: Reliance on third-party services introduces a dependency that could impact service availability and control.
  - **Costs**: Transaction fees associated with these services may increase operational costs.
  - **Integration Complexity**: Integrating these services requires careful handling to ensure security and data privacy are maintained.
