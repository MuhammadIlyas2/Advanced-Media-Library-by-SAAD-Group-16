# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for Our Project

## Overview
This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Advanced Media Library System. ADRs are documents that capture critical architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences.

## Purpose
The purpose of maintaining ADRs is to ensure that we have a historical record of architectural decisions. This aids in understanding the project's evolution and provides new team members with insight into past decisions.

## How to Use
- To view a decision record, select the ADR file named with the corresponding decision number and title.
- To propose a new decision, copy the `template.md`, fill in the necessary details, and submit it as a pull request.

## ADR Template
Each ADR should follow the format specified in `template.md` which includes sections for status, context, decision, and consequences.

## Key ADRs in our project
1. [ADR 1: Adopt Service-Oriented Architecture Style](0001-adopt-service-oriented-architecture-style.md)
2. [ADR 2: Choice of Technology Stack](0002-choice-of-technology-stack.md)
3. [ADR 0003: Rejection of SQLite for Database Management]()
