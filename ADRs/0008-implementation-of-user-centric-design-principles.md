# ADR 0008: Implementation of User-Centric Design Principles

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
The success of the Advanced Media Library System largely depends on its usability and accessibility. Considering the diverse user base, including individuals with disabilities, it is essential to adhere to user-centric design principles that cater to all users' needs. This approach ensures that the system is not only compliant with legal standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but also provides a seamless and inclusive user experience.

## Decision
We propose to implement user-centric design principles across the entire interface of the Advanced Media Library System. Key aspects will include:

- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensuring the system meets WCAG 2.1 standards at least to the AA level.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating designs that function well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Developing a clear and logical navigation structure that allows users to find information easily.
- **Feedback and Error Handling**: Providing immediate, understandable feedback when users interact with the system, especially in error conditions.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - **Increased User Satisfaction**: By focusing on the needs and comfort of all users, the system is likely to see higher engagement and satisfaction rates.
  - **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Meets legal requirements for accessibility, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties.
  - **Broader Reach**: A more accessible and easy-to-use system can attract a wider audience, including those with varying levels of ability.
  
- **Negative**:
  - **Increased Development Time and Cost**: Implementing thorough user-centric designs can require more time and resources, potentially impacting the project timeline and budget.
  - **Complexity in Design Consistency**: Maintaining design consistency across various components while adhering to accessibility standards can be challenging.
