# ADR 0006: Implement Robust Error Handling and Logging Mechanisms

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
Given the distributed nature of the Advanced Media Library System, it is essential to have comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms. These mechanisms are crucial for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues that may arise during the operation of the system. Effective logging can also provide insights into system usage and performance, which are valuable for ongoing maintenance and optimization.

## Decision
We propose to implement a centralized logging system that will collect logs from all services in the architecture. Additionally, standardized error handling protocols will be established across all services to ensure consistency in how errors are managed and reported. The key components of this system will include:

- **Centralized Logging**: Utilizing tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar to aggregate logs in a single location that can be easily queried and monitored.
- **Standardized Error Responses**: Implementing a common error object response structure across all APIs to maintain consistency in error reporting.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**: Setting up real-time monitoring of logs and automated alerts for critical errors or unusual activities.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Improved ability to quickly identify and rectify errors across the system, enhancing overall reliability and user satisfaction.
  - Enhanced monitoring capabilities that allow for proactive management of system health and performance.
  - Standardization of error responses improves the maintainability of the system and the development experience.
  
- **Negative**:
  - Potential performance overhead due to logging processes, especially if not properly configured.
  - Requires additional resources for setup and maintenance of the logging infrastructure.
  - The complexity of managing a centralized system and ensuring it does not become a bottleneck.
