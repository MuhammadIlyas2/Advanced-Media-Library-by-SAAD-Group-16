# ADR 0005: Implementation of JWT for Authentication

## Status
- Proposed

## Context
In developing the Advanced Media Library System, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication across various services in our service-oriented architecture is critical. The system needs a robust method to authenticate and authorize users that can also support stateless operations given the distributed nature of our services.

## Decision
We propose to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT provides a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - **Stateless Operation**: JWT supports stateless authentication, which aligns well with our scalable service-oriented architecture by not requiring sessions to be stored on the server.
  - **Scalability**: Using JWT facilitates scaling as it does not require a central server to store session data.
  - **Flexibility and Security**: JWT can include expiration times and can be easily transmitted over networks and between different domains securely.
  
- **Negative**:
  - **Security Risks**: If not implemented correctly, such as not using HTTPS, JWTs can be intercepted. Proper measures and practices must be adopted to mitigate such risks.
  - **Complexity in Token Management**: Handling token expiration, renewal, and potential token theft require robust security mechanisms and clear strategies.
